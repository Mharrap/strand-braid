//! Finish MP4 recordings whose timestamp-embedding rewrite a crash interrupted.
//!
//! Strand Camera and Braid record an MP4 through ffmpeg in two stages: ffmpeg
//! encodes the video while each frame's capture time is logged to a temporary
//! `<name>-ffmpeg-rewriter.srt` sidecar, and when the recording is closed the
//! MP4 is re-muxed (without transcoding) so that every frame carries its capture
//! time as a precision-timestamp SEI NAL unit. A crash, power loss or `kill -9`
//! in between leaves that second stage undone: the video is there, but its
//! timestamps are only in the sidecar, and a partial `<name>.mp4-rewritten.mp4`
//! may be lying around too.
//!
//! This tool finds such recordings by those leftover files and finishes them,
//! producing exactly the MP4 the interrupted recording would have produced.
//!
//! What cannot be recovered is the tail: the sidecar is written one frame behind
//! (a frame's entry needs the *next* frame's time to close it), so the group of
//! pictures being encoded when the crash happened has no timing and is dropped.
//! Everything before it is kept.
