//! Detect MP4 or raw Annex B `.h264` files whose timing metadata is
//! inconsistent with the true presentation order encoded in the H.264
//! bitstream itself.
//!
//! There are two places a recording states timing, and either can be wrong:
//!
//!  * the MP4 container's `stts`/`ctts` boxes, which is what a player uses to
//!    order frames; and
//!  * the per-frame precision-timestamp SEI embedded in the bitstream (written
//!    by strand-cam / braid), which can itself be mistagged at record time
//!    (e.g. paired with the wrong encoder output when B-frame reordering delays
//!    that output relative to when it was submitted), independent of what the
//!    container boxes say.
//!
//! The one signal that cannot lie is the bitstream's own picture order count
//! (POC, ITU-T H.264 §8.2.1): every slice header carries enough information to
//! reconstruct the true relative display order of samples, independent of any
//! container metadata or of what a (possibly buggy) writer put in the SEI. This
//! tool decodes POC for every sample and checks that, walked in POC order, each
//! available timing series comes out non-decreasing. It checks the container
//! timing for every MP4 (so even a plain ffmpeg recording with no SEI can be
//! verified) and the precision-timestamp SEI wherever it is present (the only
//! signal for a raw `.h264` file). Any series that is not monotonic in POC
//! order means that timing disagrees with the bitstream's real display order,
//! and the file is broken.
